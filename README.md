## Hi there!

🌍 &nbsp; I'm an Earth & Climate scientist, currently working as a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Geography Department at the University of Oregon! I study how ice has shaped the history of our planet, from glaciers which covered our planet during the last Ice Age, to how recent ice responded to our planet's climate at the start of the industrial revolution. 

🪨 &nbsp; I'm also passionate about science communication through classroom visits, museum outreach, and talking about rocks to anyone who will listen. If you want an example, try my interview about [ROCKS!](https://www.alieward.com/ologies/geology) on the Ologies Podcast!

🎨 &nbsp; Coding is also creative! I've been taking my coding experience and love of building creative projects and learning about game design!
