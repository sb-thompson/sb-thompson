### Hi there 

🌍 I'm an Earth & Climate scientist, currently working as a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Geography Department at the University of Oregon! I study how ice has shaped the history of our planet

They study the Greenland ice sheet and how it has changed over the last few centuries, as part of a larger interest in how ice has shaped the history of our planet. Additionally, they are passionate about earth & climate science communication through classroom visits, museum outreach, and talking about rocks to anyone who will listen.
